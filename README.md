# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-and-Solution-Algorithm

I did this project for “Analysis of Algorithms Course”. I developed an algorithm for solving the TSP in Java. Firstly, the algorithm was starting from random city and was traversing the nearest cities respectively. Then, it was implementing an optimization method and was finding the shortest path.
